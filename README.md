# Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

In the world of finance, the stock market plays a crucial role in investment decisions. Investors are always looking for ways to predict stock prices and make informed trading decisions. Machine learning techniques have gained significant popularity in this domain due to their potential in analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that can be used for predicting future stock prices.

## Problem Statement:

The problem addressed in this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict stock market prices. The goal is to enable investors, particularly non-professional ones, to identify the best stocks from a given index and make investment decisions with a high level of precision. The target is to predict whether the closing price of a stock will increase by 15% in 20 market days with no significant losses exceeding 10% during that period.

## Solution:

To tackle this problem, a binary classification approach is employed. A dataset is collected, consisting of various features such as company information, age, market data, volume, and historical prices. The dataset is preprocessed, including steps such as feature scaling using techniques like StandardScaler to normalize the numerical data. Machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines can be employed to build the predictive model. The model is trained on historical stock market data, with the target variable indicating whether the price increase condition is met (1) or not (0).

## Dataset:

The project utilizes the Tesla Stock Price dataset for training and evaluating the machine learning model. This dataset contains historical stock market data for Tesla, including columns such as:

- Date: The date of the trading session, providing a chronological order for analyzing stock price trends over time.
- Open: The opening price of Tesla's stock for a particular trading session, indicating the price at which trading began.
- High: The highest price reached by Tesla's stock during the trading session, reflecting potential price peaks.
- Low: The lowest price reached by Tesla's stock during the trading session, reflecting potential price troughs.
- Close: The closing price of Tesla's stock for a particular trading session, representing the final traded price for the day.
- Volume: The total number of shares of Tesla's stock traded during the session, reflecting liquidity and investor interest.

By utilizing this dataset, the machine learning model learns from the historical price patterns of Tesla's stock and predicts whether the closing price will increase by 15% within 20 market days.

## Conclusion:

The developed machine learning model provides a solution for predicting stock market prices, with a focus on identifying stocks with a potential 15% price increase within 20 market days. By analyzing historical data of Tesla's stock and leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model offers non-professional investors a tool for making more informed investment decisions. However, it is important to note that stock market prediction is a challenging task due to volatility and complexity. The model's performance should be continuously evaluated and refined for accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, other factors such as market trends, economic indicators, and news events should be considered alongside the model's predictions for making investment decisions.
